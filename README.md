# Trine_Reminder

Same as Trine_Reminder_Local, but configured differently so it can be deployed to heroku. See how it looks @ https://trine-scraper.herokuapp.com/


NOTE: site should be mostly readable across screen sizes; however, I don't have time to perfect everything across all devices. If some of the content gets cut off, please resize the window, change to landscape mode or try on another device.

Thank you for checking it out!
